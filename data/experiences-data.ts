    fullDescription:
      "Immerse yourself in one of Japan's most refined cultural traditions with this authentic tea ceremony experience in Kyoto. Hosted in a centuries-old tea house nestled in a peaceful Japanese garden, this intimate ceremony offers a window into the heart of Japanese aesthetics and philosophy. \n\nYour experience begins with a short introduction to the history and significance of the Japanese tea ceremony (chado or 'the way of tea'), which dates back to the 9th century and was later refined into an art form that embodies harmony, respect, purity, and tranquility. \n\nGuided by a certified tea master wearing a traditional kimono, you'll learn about the meticulous preparation and presentation of matcha (powdered green tea), the significance of each utensil, and the meaning behind every graceful movement. The tea master will demonstrate the proper techniques before inviting you to prepare your own bowl of matcha following the traditional methods. \n\nAs you sip your tea, you'll also enjoy seasonal wagashi (traditional Japanese sweets) that complement the slightly bitter flavor of the matcha. Throughout the ceremony, your host will explain the deeper philosophical concepts of mindfulness and being present in the moment that are central to this practice. \n\nThis experience is conducted in a small group setting, ensuring personal attention and the opportunity to ask questions. You'll leave with not just memories of a unique cultural experience, but with a deeper understanding of Japanese values and aesthetics.",
